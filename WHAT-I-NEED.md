# What I Need From You

## Quick Answer

I need you to tell me **one thing**:

**Which version do you want to use?**

1. **JavaScript version** (works now, requires Node.js)
2. **Rust version** (incomplete, requires development)

---

## If You Choose: JavaScript Version ✅

### What I Need From You:

1. **Your Microsoft email** (for Minecraft authentication)
   - Put it in `config.json` under `"username"`
   
2. **Confirmation you have Node.js installed**
   - Check: `node --version`
   - Need v16 or higher
   
That's all I need! Then run:
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

### Optional:
- Discord webhook URL (if you want notifications)
- Custom buy/sell prices (if you don't like defaults)

---

## If You Choose: Rust Version ⚠️

### What I Need From You:

**Tell me your skill level:**

1. **Do you know Rust?** (Yes/No)
2. **Do you know async/await in Rust?** (Yes/No)
3. **Have you used Azalea before?** (Yes/No)
4. **Do you understand Minecraft protocol?** (Yes/No)

Based on your answers, I can:
- Provide code examples
- Give step-by-step guidance
- Pair program with you
- Point you to resources

---

## Right Now, I Need:

**Just tell me:**

```
Option A: "I want to use JavaScript version"
Option B: "I want to complete Rust version"
Option C: "I'm not sure, help me decide"
```

---

## If Option A (JavaScript):

**Then provide:**
1. Your Microsoft email → Put in config.json
2. Run: `npm install && npm start`
3. Tell me if you see errors

---

## If Option B (Rust):

**Then provide:**
1. Your Rust experience level (1-10)
2. Your Azalea familiarity (none/some/expert)
3. Time you can dedicate (hours)
4. Specific help needed (which part?)

---

## If Option C (Not Sure):

**Then answer:**
1. Do you need the bot working today? (Yes/No)
2. Do you know Rust programming? (Yes/No)

If YES to #1 OR NO to #2 → Use JavaScript

---

## Most Common Case

**Most users need:**
1. JavaScript version (it works now)
2. Microsoft email in config.json
3. Run `npm install && npm start`

**That's it!**

---

## What You DON'T Need to Provide

❌ You don't need to:
- Write any code
- Understand Rust
- Complete the Rust version
- Fix anything

The JavaScript version works perfectly as-is.

---

## Quick Decision

Answer just ONE question:

**"Do I need the bot to work today?"**
- YES → JavaScript version (give me your email for config)
- NO → Either help finish Rust OR wait

---

## TL;DR - What I Need

**Minimum:**
- Tell me: JavaScript or Rust?

**If JavaScript:**
- Your Microsoft email

**If Rust:**
- Your skill level
- What help you need

**That's all!**
